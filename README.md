Namibia Elevation & Geologic Map

This repository contains a map visualisation of Namibia’s elevation and geological features, created using QGIS with datasets from USGS and NASA SRTM (30m).

Overview
The map combines:
Elevation data: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM, 30m resolution)
Geological data: USGS public datasets

This visualisation highlights Namibia’s diverse topography from rugged highlands to coastal plains and its underlying geology.

Tools & Data Sources
Software: QGIS
Data Sources:
	 USGS Geological Data
	 NASA SRTM 30m Elevation Data

Purpose
This project demonstrates the integration of elevation and geological data for:
	 Exploration insights
	 Environmental and land-use planning
	 Educational purposes

Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, this map is a general representation based on publicly available datasets. It is not suitable for navigation or precise geological exploration.
